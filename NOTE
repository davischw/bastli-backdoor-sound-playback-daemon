depends on sdl_mixer, install under arch with
 sudo pacman -S extra/sdl_mixer

also depends on sdl, but that should be already installed
as a dependency when installing sdl_mixer

depends on librabbitmq
no package on arch linux available
library installation on arch linux strange
on debian install package librabbitmq1

depends on json-c, which is the only one i managed
to get to run with arch because it was already
installed (why are the infos on arch packages website
and in pacman completely different?):
local/json-c

depends on a libc which supports the %z printf formatstring
modifier, MSVC uses %I instead of the standard, thanks oballmer

build with make

user running the software has to be in the audio group:
 sudo usermod -aG audio <user>
then logout and login again with <user>

accepts sound file names that don't contain a forward or
backward slash (so no folder/subfolder files possible).
the maximum filename length is fixed by the preprocessor
macro FNBUF_S defined in soundserver_child_main.h


# outdated
compile with
 gcc -lSDL_mixer -lSDL -lrabbitmq -o sound_test soundserver_test_main.c
