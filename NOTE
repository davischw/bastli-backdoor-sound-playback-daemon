This software listens on rabbitmq messages that are actually a
command to open a lock (eg. backdoor) and plays a sound depending
on the user that opens the lock or a specified sound file.


### Dependencies

* libvlc-dev
* librabbitmq-dev
* json-c

#### stille

* libao-dev
* libasound2-plugins

### Building

build with make


### Usage hints

user running the software has to be in the audio group:
 sudo usermod -aG audio <user>
then logout and login again with <user>

On a raspberry pi with HDMI monitor connected, alsa might
use sound output over HDMI instead of headphone jack by
default. To force headphone jack output, run:
sudo amixer -c 0 cset numid=3 1

To run in background, use daemonize(1), an excellent wrapper
that prevents lock-in to a specific init system. On arch no
package seems to exist, install according to instructions:
http://software.clapper.org/daemonize/


### Usage

run ummah mod with
./ummah.exe

run ummah mod in background with
daemonize -c /home/bastli/soundserver/ -p /var/run/soundserver.pid -l /var/lock/soundserver.lock /home/bastli/soundserver/ummah.exe
